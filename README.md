==================

Compiler for a relatively simple language with contextual restrictions

Done with ANTLR 2.7, already deprecated.
As I found quite hard to get my hands on an ANTLR 2.7 example of a grammar with ecuations for contextual restrictions, well, here it is.

You can find examples of the implemented language in the "ejemplos" folder.
